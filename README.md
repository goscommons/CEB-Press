## Highlights
The Liberator is OSE's automatic, high throughput Compressed Earth Brick Press. It is named The Liberator because it is intended to free people from the single highest cost of living - housing. See Cost of Living and GVCS Naming Convention.
## Sepcifications
- Block is plain block, not interlocking. Please see discussion on Interlocking_bricks
- Version 17.08 is our most current model. See CEB Press Genealogy for past versions.
- Open source hardware, controller, and software (CC-BY-SA 4.0, GPLv3)
- Controller includes automatic pressing and manual mode
- Does NOT come with a power source - it is powered by a hydraulic power source, such as by our Power Cube or a - tractor hydraulic take-off.
- Full size bricks are 4"x6"x12", plain flat-faced bricks
- Brick height is adjustable from 2"-4"
- Brick dimensional variations: +/- 1/16". This assumes uniform soil. Soil uniformity will determine height uniformity of brick.
- 6 full-sized bricks per minute at 14 gallon per minute hydraulic flow. Brick pressing rate will increase with a higher hydraulic flow, up to the maximum rated flow of the hydraulic solenoid. Hydraulic solenoid valve is rated for a maximum of 30 gpm fluid flow at 3000PSI.
- Fuel consumption with Power Cube running at 14 gpm fluid flow - about 1 gallon per hour
- System hydraulic pressure - 2300 psi
- Comes with hydraulic quick couplers ready to be connected to a power source
- Weight - 1700 lb
- Moving: brick press is moved with forks. Footprint (with legs in the inner position) allows machine to be placed in the bed of a 3/4 ton pickup. It has adjustable legs for uneven terrain. Machine can be moved around on a trailer (not included)
- Material cost: $3000-$6500 depending on suppliers; manual machine (without hydraulic solenoid, machine costs $1000 less in materials. Production cost for a full kit: US$5000 above the bill of materials/supplies/consumables cost, paid by the buyer.
3'x6' grate for loading the machine with a tractor. Includes soil deflectors
